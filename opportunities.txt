Opportunities

We welcome expressions of interest from honours, PhD, and postdoctoral researchers, as well as clinical collaborators. Backgrounds spanning psychology, neuroscience, computer science, biomedical engineering, or related fields are encouraged.

Example directions
• Probabilistic models of perception and decision making
• Eye movement control and dynamic perceptual inference
• Resource-limited coding: crowding, attention, memory precision
• Computational psychiatry / neurology links to sensory function

How to contact us:
• Email a brief statement of interests to Will: wharrison@usc.edu.au
• I'm always keen to jump on zoom for a chat to see what's possible!
