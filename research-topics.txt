Research Topics

Population Coding & Probabilistic Inference
We investigate how ensembles of neurons represent information and uncertainty, and how those
representations support Bayesian inference in perception and action.

Visual Perception
Projects include crowding in peripheral vision, illusory contours, attentional cueing, and
the interaction between eye movements and moment-to-moment perception.

Working Memory & Decision Processes
We study short-term memory capacity limits, precision-resource trade-offs, and how noisy
evidence is integrated over time to guide choices.

Methods
• Psychophysics (thresholds, reverse correlation, confidence/readouts)
• Eye tracking & oculomotor paradigms
• Computational modeling (Bayesian observers, diffusion/accumulator models)
• Model-based inference & parameter recovery
• (Optional) EEG/MEG collaborations for population-level signals

Translational Links
We aim to map computational deficits to clinical phenotypes and inform assessment and
intervention for disorders of vision, attention, and decision making.
