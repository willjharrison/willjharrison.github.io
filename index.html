    <h2>Research Interests</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Active visual perception:</strong> This research interest focuses on understanding how we actively explore and perceive our environment using vision. It investigates the mechanisms that drive our attention and eye movements, and how these influence our visual perception.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Visual working memory:</strong> This area of research explores the cognitive processes that allow us to temporarily store and manipulate visual information. It seeks to understand the capacity, limitations, and neural basis of visual working memory.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Natural image statistics:</strong> This research interest examines the statistical properties of natural images and how they shape our visual processing. It aims to reveal how the brain has adapted to efficiently process the visual environment in which we live.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Neural encoding:</strong> This area of research investigates how the brain represents and processes visual information at the neural level. It aims to understand the coding principles and neural mechanisms that underlie our ability to perceive and interpret visual stimuli.
