    <h2>Research Interests</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Active visual perception:</strong> In my research on active visual perception, I strive to understand how we actively explore and perceive our environment using vision. I investigate the mechanisms that drive our attention and eye movements and how these factors influence our visual perception.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Visual working memory:</strong> My work in visual working memory explores the cognitive processes that allow us to temporarily store and manipulate visual information. I aim to understand the capacity, limitations, and neural basis of visual working memory.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Natural image statistics:</strong> My research on natural image statistics examines the statistical properties of natural images and how they shape our visual processing. I seek to reveal how the brain has adapted to efficiently process the visual environment in which we live.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Neural encoding:</strong> My work in neural encoding investigates how the brain represents and processes visual information at the neural level. I aim to understand the coding principles and neural mechanisms that underlie our ability to perceive and interpret visual stimuli.
