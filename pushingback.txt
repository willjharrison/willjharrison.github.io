<p>Modern artificial intelligence has achieved remarkable feats, but we suggest it is not yet fit for purpose for understanding many topics in neuroscience and cognition. Our primary argument is simple: <b>we cannot explain the brain by simply comparing it to another system that is itself opaque and requires entire fields to interpret.</b></p>
<p>Our approach is different: rather than substituting one black box for another, we ground our explanations in <em>biological data</em> and <em>theoretical principles</em>. We study what neurons compute, how populations encode information, and how these processes support human experience. AI models can be useful tools, but they are not the object of explanation. For cognitive neuroscience, the challenge is to understand <strong>how brains themselves work</strong> — not just whether an artificial system can produce similar outputs.</p>
<p> By pushing back on simplistic comparisons, we justify an approach that integrates psychophysics, neural data, and computational theory.  This way, we aim to explain human intelligence at every level — from single neurons to conscious decision making — on its own terms.</p>
