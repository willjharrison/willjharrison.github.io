<p>The <strong>Sensory Intelligence Research Group</strong> is interested in understanding how the brain gives rise to our thoughts, feelings and actions. Our goal is to integrate knowledge to build a comprehensive model of how the brain encodes the world so that we can predict what a person would see or think at any given moment. Our mission, therefore, is to work across levels of explanation — empirical, theoretical, and philosophical — to uncover how the brain turns raw sensory signals into meaningful perception and action. The group is led by <strong>Dr Will Harrison</strong> <a href="https://www.usc.edu.au/staff/dr-will-harrison" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at the University of the Sunshine Coast</a>.</p>
<p>By <strong>sensory intelligence</strong> we mean the capacity of the nervous system to transform raw signals from the world into useful information for behaviour. Every single neuron has been shaped by evolutionary pressures to compute some attribute of the environment. In the case of the visual brain, neurons encode edges in a scene, the colours of objects, as well as the timing of different events. We often think of intelligence only in terms of its end point, such as reasoning or decision making, but we study across levels: from the abilities of individual neurons, to the coordinated activity of populations, and ultimately to the whole system that supports perception, thought, and action. This perspective highlights why understanding the brain’s sensory computations is central to explaining the mind.</p>
<!-- <h3>What We Study</h3>
<p>We are fascinated by the <em>phenomenological experience</em> of our senses. For example, there is <i>feeling</I> of seeing, a qualia. We ask how these rich experiences emerge from neural populations: how groups of neurons encode and combine information sensed from the environment, and how these computations shape both <strong>perception</strong> and <strong>decision making</strong>. By studying how neural codes determine perception and cognition, we aim to explain not just the mechanics of the brain, but the very nature of how the world is experienced.</p> -->
<h3>Why It Matters</h3>
<p>Understanding these computations is not just a scientific challenge, but also a path to impact. We aim to translate our insights to health, seeking principled ways to understand, detect, and improve sensory and cognitive disorders. By bridging basic science and application, we hope to contribute to healthier minds and more informed approaches to human well-being.</p>
