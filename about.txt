The human brain is more powerful than any artificial system we've created, so far. The <strong>Sensory Intelligence Research Group</strong> is interested in understanding how the brain gives rise to our thoughts, feelings and actions. We see human experience as a kind of problem solving that begins with the sensory demands of the environment. Our goal is to build such a comprehensive model of how the brain encodes the world that we are able to predict what a person would see or think when they look at an arbitrary image. Our mission, therefore, is to work across levels of explanation — empirical, theoretical, and philosophical — to uncover how the brain turns raw sensory signals into meaningful perception and action.

The group is led by <strong>Dr Will Harrison</strong> at the University of the Sunshine Coast.

<h3>What We Study</h3>
<p>
We are fascinated by the <em>phenomenological experience</em> of our senses. For example, there is <i>feeling</i> of seeing, a qualia. We ask how these rich experiences emerge from neural populations: how groups of neurons encode and combine information sensed from the environment, and how these computations shape both <strong>perception</strong> and <strong>decision making</strong>. By studying how neural codes determine perception and cognition, we aim to explain not just the mechanics of the brain, but the very nature of how the world is experienced.

<h3>Why It Matters</h3>
<p>
Understanding these computations is not just a scientific challenge, but also a path to impact. We aim to translate our insights to health, seeking principled ways to understand, detect, and improve sensory and cognitive disorders. By bridging basic science and application, we hope to contribute to healthier minds and more informed approaches to human well-being.
