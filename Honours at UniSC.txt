    <h1>Thinking of doing your Honours thesis with me?</h1>
    <p>
      I supervise Honours students in the Psychology program at the
      <strong>University of the Sunshine Coast (UniSC)</strong>.
      If you choose to work with me, your Honours research will be conducted under the
      <a href="https://www.usc.edu.au/study/courses-and-programs/courses/course-library/psy/psy408a-research-dissertation-a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PSY408A</a> /
      <a href="https://www.usc.edu.au/study/courses-and-programs/courses/course-library/psy/psy408b-research-dissertation-b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PSY408B</a>
      Research Dissertation sequence, which is the core of the Honours thesis at UniSC.
    </p>
    <p>
      In <strong>PSY408A</strong> (first trimester), you will develop and begin your research proposal:
      reviewing literature, choosing measures, planning methods, seeking ethical approval, and defining your question.
      In <strong>PSY408B</strong> (second trimester), you will collect data, perform the analyses, and write up your dissertation.

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <h3>How many students do you take?</h3>
    <p>
      Each year I supervise between <strong>3 and 5</strong> Honours students. This allows me to give
      each student plenty of individual attention while also building a small, supportive peer group.
    </p>

    <h3>What kinds of projects have students done before?</h3>
    <p>
      Past projects have covered perception, cognition, and statistics—for example:
      detecting patterns in noisy environments, how memory limits shape decision-making,
      and how eye movements influence what we see. Projects typically involve behavioural experiments
      with careful analysis, and sometimes computational modelling.
    </p>

    <h3>Will you give me a project, or do I design my own?</h3>
    <p>
      I can provide a project idea if you’d like a clear starting point. However, the best projects usually
      come from a conversation between us. I like to explore options and refine the idea together so the project
      feels genuinely collaborative and yours.
    </p>

    <h3>Do I need coding or maths skills?</h3>
    <p>
      Not at all. Some projects use coding or statistics more heavily, but I will guide you through anything
      you need to learn. You don’t need to be a programmer or a maths expert to do well.
    </p>

    <h3>Will I get to publish my thesis?</h3>
    <p>
      Some Honours theses I’ve supervised have been published as journal articles. That said, Honours is
      already demanding—there’s no expectation to publish during the year. If a paper is appropriate,
      we can work on it <em>after</em> Honours, and publication typically takes <strong>1–2 years</strong>.
      Your priority should be producing a solid piece of research and developing your skills; any publication
      later is a fantastic bonus.
